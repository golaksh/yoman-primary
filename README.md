Hello people!
Laksh here!
I am a 19 year old student who wants to explore the limitless possibilities of the coding world and use my knowledge to create something that would help people in their everyday lives.
I am an avid reader, a nature enthusiast and I love travelling to less-known places to find new meanings of life.
I have a high spice tolerence too!! ^_^
